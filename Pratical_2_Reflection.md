# Reflection â€“ Practical 2: TikTok REST API with Express.js

## Documentation

### Concepts Applied:

* **RESTful Routing:** Designed resource-specific endpoints using standard HTTP methods.
* **Express.js Backend:** Set up a modular Node.js server to serve API endpoints.
* **Controller Structure:** Implemented controller functions to separate logic by resource.
* **In-Memory Data Modeling:** Used mock objects to simulate a real database.
* **Modular Routing:** Created individual route files for users, videos, and comments.

## Reflection

### What I Learned:

* The principles of REST API design and why they matter for scalability and clarity.
* How to build a full Express.js backend structure with routing, middleware, and controllers.
* Managing and organizing multiple interrelated endpoints, like nested comments and video likes.
* Testing APIs with tools like curl and Postman to ensure request-response accuracy.

### Challenges Faced:

#### 1. Managing Nested Routes

Understanding how to correctly map nested routes such as `/users/:id/videos` or `/videos/:id/comments` was initially confusing. This was solved by designing route handlers that dynamically read URL parameters and structure controller logic accordingly.

#### 2. Organizing Controller Logic

Avoiding repetition and keeping controller functions concise was tricky. This required careful separation of concerns and reusable handler patterns.

### Key Takeaways:

* Modularizing route and controller logic is essential for a clean, maintainable backend.
* REST APIs are powerful and scalable when built with clear conventions and structure.
* In-memory data models are useful for prototyping APIs without database integration.
* Writing and testing endpoints early helps surface logical bugs in structure and flow.
